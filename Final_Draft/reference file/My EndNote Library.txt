	In this paper, we investigate the initial reactions and perceptions of knowledge workers to a planned implementation of robotic process automation (RPA). Using purposive sampling, we conduct a case study in an industry in which workers’ jobs are notoriously vulnerable to automation: we study an accounting firm that is planning to introduce RPA into their core accounting processes. While our informants did raise the expected concerns about job security and loss of control over work, the initial reactions to the technology were surprisingly positive. The informants even expressed enthusiasm and genuine curiosity towards the capabilities of RPA. Overall, our results challenge the views outlined in previous academic literature and popular press concerning the fears and anxieties associated with the introduction of automation technologies in information-intensive knowledge work. To conclude, we theorize on the emerging positively dispersed uncertainty concerning the nature of RPA and the relativistic nature of worker reactions that potentially impact workplace atmosphere.
